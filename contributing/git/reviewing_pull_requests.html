<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Before doing anything else, if you are reviewing a bugfix pull
request, you must first reproduce the issue on the main development
branch as mentioned in the <a class="reference internal" href="#reviewing-a-bugfix-pr"><span class="std std-ref">Reviewing a bugfix PR</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Add the following git alias to your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gitconfig</span></code> file (e.g. the one
located in your home directory):</p>
<div class="highlight-ini"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[alias]</span>
    <span class="na">pr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;!f() { \</span>
<span class="s">        git fetch -fu ${2:-&lt;remote_main&gt;} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 &amp;&amp; \</span>
<span class="s">        git checkout pr/$1; \</span>
<span class="s">    }; f&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the alias <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;remote_main&gt;</span></code> stands for the name of the remote
representing the main development repository, i.e. the one the pull
requests are sent to. Such a remote is commonly named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upstream</span></code>. You
need to make sure to insert the correct name in the above alias
definition.</p>
<p>With the alias defined, go to the project root directory and type the
following in the console:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git pr &lt;pr_number&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command will automatically fetch and checkout the branch containing
the changes in the pull request <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;pr_number&gt;</span></code>, e.g. 1234.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: The command must be run on a clean repository. If you have any
pending local changes, you first need to put them aside by running
``git stash``, or discarding them altogether.</em></p>
<p>If the pull request contains database changes (marked with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migration</span></code> label), you need to update the database as well before you
start reviewing the changes.</p>
<p>With the PR branch fetched, you need to merge it with the branch the PR
was made against, usually - but not always - <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">develop</span></code>, and test how
the <em>merged</em> code performs.</p>
<p>When you have everything set up, start the application and verify that
everything works as intended (see the <a class="reference internal" href="#reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests"><span class="std std-ref">Reviewing and merging pull requests</span></a>
for details). If the pull request turns out to be good, you can merge it,
provided that all the <a class="reference internal" href="#merging-pull-requests"><span class="std std-ref">Merging pull requests</span></a> are met.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there are <a class="reference internal" href="#acceptance-criteria"><span class="std std-ref">reasons to reject</span></a>
a pull request, leave the feedback in the comment(s), so that the author
can make the necessary changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-github-labels">
<h2>Using GitHub labels<a class="headerlink" href="#using-github-labels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several labels defined on the GitHub project repository page
that can (and should!) be used for tagging pull requests. Labeling
enables easier PR categorization and searching, thus make sure to use
them.</p>
<p>The meaning of the labels and their intended usage is as follows (sorted
alphabetically):</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">code</span> <span class="pre">freeze</span></code> - the PR should not be merged due to the ongoing QA testing.
Used at the end of the sprint, when extensive QA testing is started,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">critical</span></code> - the PR has the highest possible priority and should thus be
reviewed <em>immediately</em>. Cases when applying this label is justifiable are,
among others, when a PR fixes a blocking issue or a severe issue that needs
to be shipped to production in the shortest time possible. Should be used
sparsely,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">documentation</span></code> - the PR contains updates to project documentation,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migration</span></code> - the PR contains a migration script that changes the
database schema. Such pull requests require additional setup and
verification steps,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mising</span> <span class="pre">tests</span></code> - the changes submitted are not sufficiently covered with
automated tests, and the latter need to be added,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">needs</span> <span class="pre">work</span></code> - a reviewer or the PR author has concluded that the PR
requires additional work before it can be accepted and merged,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new</span> <span class="pre">contribution</span></code> - the PR author is a new contributor that might not yet
be familiar with the project workflow, conventions, and other nuances. Please
take extra care and effort to answer all the questions, and to explain things
as necessary in a welcoming manner, even if they might seem trivial to
a seasoned contributor,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next</span> <span class="pre">release</span></code> - the PR will be merged after the current release
has branched off of the main development branch, and should not be
merged just yet,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">hold</span></code> - the PR has been temporarily put on hold for a reason that does
not fall under any of the other labels. An example would be a case when
merging the PR would potentially result in a merge conflict with another PR
that is otherwise difficult to review and update, thus resolving such issues
would likely be easier on the (less complex) PR itself,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">please</span> <span class="pre">review</span></code> - the author asked that the PR should be reviewed
with a higher priority. This label is usually used when the PR has either
not received enough attention for a considerable period of time, attempts to
resolve an important issue, or blocks another (important) PR,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">question</span></code> - the PR author seeks advice/feedback on some code
feature and/or design decision. It can also be used by a reviewer to
ask the PR author for additional explanation before a decision can be
made on whether the PR meets all the requirements. On top of that,
this label is occasionally used when a reviewer makes a non-essential
suggestion for a PR change, but that change is not required to deem
the PR ready to merge,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrong</span> <span class="pre">branch</span></code> - the author sent the PR to the wrong branch. The
author should re-issue the same PR against the correct branch.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: The last commit <strong>must</strong> be modified and force-pushed again, so
that the tests are re-run against the new base branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Reviewing and merging pull requests<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-and-merging-pull-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, make sure that you have properly set up the local
environment, then follow the guidelines described in the next couple of
sections.</p>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-a-new-feature-pr">
<h3>Reviewing a new feature PR<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-a-new-feature-pr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The philosophy is simple - verify that the PR implements everything that
is required by the corresponding project task / specification. While
reviewing, it is highly recommended that you also test a few other
application features that might have been affected by the submitted code
changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-a-hotfix-pr">
<span id="id2"></span><h3>Reviewing a hotfix PR<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-a-hotfix-pr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hotfixes are all pull requests that go straight into master or release branch.
Review of such branches needs to be done by at least 2 people from the
freemasons committee. The changes allowed must be the minimum amount of changes
to fix a given bug. Hotfix PRs are not allowed to contain any lint or style
changes outside of the that needs to be changed in order to avoid any possible
conflicts when doing a merge back into the develop branch.</p>
<p>After merging a hotfix PR We must create a backemerge PR from master to release
(if needed) and from release to dev branch. Developer who opens those PR must
ensure they get merged as soon as possible, again to as many conflicts as
possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-a-bugfix-pr">
<span id="id3"></span><h3>Reviewing a bugfix PR<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-a-bugfix-pr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If reviewing a pull request that contains a bug fix, you <strong>must</strong> first
reproduce the bug on the vanilla <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> branch, i.e. the one
without the PR branch merged. Only after the bug has been reproduced,
you can actually verify that the PR indeed fixes something.</p>
<p>Again, try to also check that the bugfix has not accidentally introduced
any other issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-a-pr-containing-database-migration-scripts">
<h3>Reviewing a PR containing database migration scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-a-pr-containing-database-migration-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note: Before clicking &#8220;Merge pull request&#8221;, a developer must test the
migrations once again by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git pr &lt;pr_number&gt;
db_reset
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is needed because migration chain can be out of date if another
migration PR was merged after the last commit on the current PR has
been pushed.</p>
<p>Pull requests that modify the database (marked with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migration</span></code>
label) require additional checks to be performed on top of all the
others regular checks, namely the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The migration works from a clean database,</li>
<li>Downgrading and upgrading work on a clean database,</li>
<li>Migrations work from the current database state on the main
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> branch,</li>
<li>Migrations work on a populated database (using the data from the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">grc-dev</span></code> instance).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="acceptance-criteria">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>Acceptance criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#acceptance-criteria" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A pull request <strong>must be rejected</strong> if <strong>any</strong> of the following is true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It does not do/fix what it claims to and/or it does that only
partially,</li>
<li>The review reveals that the PR has introduced new issues,</li>
<li>At least one of the automatic checks on the continuous integration
server fails, i.e. the build is broken,</li>
<li>The new code contains severe readability, logical, performance, and/or
architectural issues,</li>
<li>The new code is not sufficiently covered with automated tests
(subject to exceptions, e.g. when a test would be disproportionally
difficult and time-consuming to write, or for little UI changes like
changing an icon or a font color).</li>
</ul>
<p>The reviewer must mark the pull request with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">needs</span> <span class="pre">work</span></code> label,
signaling to the author that the PR cannot yet been merged as-is, and
additional changes are required. Along with the tagging, the reviewer
should clearly explain why the PR has temporarily been rejected, and
what needs to be done before it can be merged.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the PR looks good, it can be merged immediately
(subject to the conditions described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#merging-pull-requests"><span class="std std-ref">Merging pull requests</span></a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, a PR looks good, but the reviewer is nevertheless
not yet 100% confident with merging it, usually due to its complexity
and/or size, or his own lesser familiarity with the project codebase. In
such cases, the reviewer can still express the approval of the PR, but
defer the final verdict on merging to other reviewers (assign if necessary).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merging-pull-requests">
<span id="id5"></span><h3>Merging pull requests<a class="headerlink" href="#merging-pull-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A pull request can be merged only if <strong>all</strong> of the following is true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>You</em> have gone through all the verification steps and concluded that
everything works as expected (other people&#8217;s approvals by themselves
<em>are not enough</em>!),</li>
<li>All automatic continuous integration checks have passed,</li>
<li>The pull request does not contain <strong>any of your commits</strong>. You are
not allowed to merge your own work, including the pull requests that
you have at least partially contributed to,</li>
<li>The pull request is <strong>not</strong> labeled with any of the &#8220;blocking&#8221; labels
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">code</span> <span class="pre">freeze</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">missing</span> <span class="pre">tests</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">needs</span> <span class="pre">work</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next</span> <span class="pre">release</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">hold</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">question</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrong</span> <span class="pre">branch</span></code>), meaning that not all open
questions and issues have been resolved yet,</li>
<li>The pull request does <strong>not</strong> have any Reviewers assigned that have not yet
completed their review (seek information on why, if necessary), or if at
least one of the reviewers has requested changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: After merging a PR that contains a database migration step, the reviewer
must mark all other currently open migration PRs with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">needs</span> <span class="pre">work</span></code> label,
and add a note containing the new <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down_revision</span></code> value in the database
migration chain, so that the authors of those PRs can update their migration
scripts accordingly.
Mind that this only applies to the PRs containing migration scripts in the same
application module as the just merged PR.</p>

<p>Here <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;remote_main&gt;</span></code> stands for the name of the <em>remote</em>

<p><em>NOTE: If the pull request was made against a branch other than

<p>Here <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;pr_origin&gt;</span></code> stands for the name of the <em>remote</em> the pull

<p>If the pull request is marked with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migration</span></code> label, it
modifies the database schema, and you thus need to update the schema
locally as well.</p>
<p>First, backup the current development database by running the

<p>With the backup successfully created, run the actual database
migration:</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">db_migrate</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>NOTE: Database migration must be run from the latest database state
